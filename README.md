![Mping monitoring a live show network](docs/mping-demo.gif)

## What is Mping?

Network monitoring built for show engineers, not IT departments. Everything on one canvas, readable at a glance from the FOH position.

- Know the instant a device drops — with **no false alerts**
- Your whole network as an interactive topology map
- The numbers that matter: RTT, jitter, packet loss, fibre loss, SFP temperature and signal
- Built around **Netgear AV**, **AVB/Milan**, **L-Acoustics** and fibre rigs

## Features

*Every screenshot below is Mping's built-in example workspace — a redundant four-switch fibre rig with access points — exactly as the app draws it.*

### The whole rig on one canvas

<img src="docs/screenshots/topology.png" alt="Live topology canvas: four zones, fibre links with loss and bandwidth, an RSTP-blocked redundant path" width="100%" />

Every switch, amplifier and access point is a live tile — round-trip time, temperature and status readable from across the room. Fibre links are discovered automatically over LLDP and drawn with **per-end optical loss in dB** and **live per-port bandwidth**. Traffic direction animates toward the root bridge, and a blocked redundant path is drawn as exactly that — an orange dashed line, not a healthy link. Zone boxes group the rig the way it is racked, tiles drag freely, and a venue plan can sit behind everything (PNG, JPEG or PDF, with smart invert so black-on-white drawings read correctly on the dark canvas).

### Ping you can trust

A device is **never marked offline until a verification burst confirms it** — one lost packet on a busy network does not page you. Round-trip times are stamped by the kernel at packet arrival, so the numbers match `ping` in a terminal instead of inheriting the app's scheduling noise. Loss %, jitter and uptime are tracked per device, and jitter alerts only fire on a breach sustained across consecutive real cycles.

<tr>
<td width="55%" valign="top">

### Fibre and SFP optics, per module

Optical TX/RX power, temperature, voltage and laser bias for every SFP, read over DDM. Link labels carry the measured **loss of each direction** of every span, with alerts on your dB threshold — and a link whose light disappears goes red immediately. Copper SFPs are told apart from optical automatically, so the map never claims fibre where there is none.

<tr>
<td width="55%" valign="top">

### Spanning tree, drawn honestly

STP state lives right on the map: the root bridge wears a gold badge, blocked redundant paths draw as dashed amber, and traffic-flow arrows animate toward the root — computed from the switches' own designated-bridge votes. If the data cannot prove a direction, Mping draws **no arrow rather than a guessed one**.

### Redundant networks are first-class

Primary and secondary planes as two tabs of one workspace. Devices pair with their redundant twins, share canvas position and port-box layout, and wear P/S badges. Each plane keeps its own topology, its own link map and its own alert focus — clicking a secondary alert takes you to the secondary plane.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="55%" valign="top">

### Heat, before it becomes a problem

Both temperature sensors and all four fans of every switch, polled continuously with configurable alert thresholds. The Temperatures plane turns every tile into a **rolling one-hour graph** of sensors and fans, with hover readouts — a quiet rack at load-in and a hot one at showtime are one glance apart.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="55%" valign="top">

### Search that knows your patch

Search matches devices — and **switch ports**, by LLDP neighbour name or by the endpoint IP resolved from the switch's own learned-MAC and ARP tables. Type an device's IP and Mping finds the port it is plugged into, opens that switch's port box, and flashes the exact cell.

### One click, whole story

The inspector shows a device's live RTT sparkline, loss, jitter and uptime, temperature history, and a card per SFP — TX/RX, temperature, voltage, bias, vendor and serial. Per-device toggles for ping and SNMP monitoring, and a protocols strip showing per-transport health at a glance.

### Set up a rig in minutes

Add a show's worth of devices in one action, then **paste names and IPs straight from a spreadsheet** — the table fills live as you paste. Bulk-edit zone, type, community and monitoring state across a selection. In redundant mode the manager pairs both networks side by side.

### And for the engineer who reads spec sheets

- **Port status boxes** — a draggable companion per switch that replicates the physical racks with your kit in: per-column heights, drag-in placement, cells labelled with LLDP name, endpoint IP or drop counters, red-until-verified on reopen
- **Alerts that latch** — offline, RTT, jitter, fibre loss and temperature alerts stand until acknowledged, with full history; recovered-but-unacknowledged shows amber, and macOS notifications reach you when Mping is in the background
- **Hold ⌥ Option** to flip every tile's IP to its MAC address, learned live from the network
- **Honest by design** — topology memory is session-only: every launch draws only what the switches prove now, never yesterday's assumptions
- **One portable file** — a workspace is a single `.mpw` including the venue plan; open it on another Mac and the whole rig comes with it
- **Multi-NIC aware** — ping and SNMP bind to the interface you choose per device, built for FOH Macs riding two networks at once
- **Show-safe footprint** — engineered for low CPU and few wake-ups so the Monitoring Mac stays cool and silent; read-only throughout: Mping never writes a single setting to any device

## Install

1. Download **`Mping-x.y.z.dmg`** from the [**latest release**](https://github.com/therealjackiewelles/Mping/releases/latest)
2. Open it and drag **Mping** into Applications
3. **First launch: right-click Mping → Open**, then click Open again

> **Step 3 is not optional.** Mping is not yet notarised by Apple, so double-clicking it the first time shows a warning and refuses to launch. Right-click → Open is the way past it, and macOS only asks once. If macOS says the app is *"damaged"*, that is the same thing — the file is fine.

Workspaces are stored in `~/Documents/Mping`, never inside the app, so updates never touch your data.

**Updates:** Mping checks GitHub on launch and once a day. Feature releases offer to download and install themselves; patch releases are quiet — check any time via **Mping → Check for Updates…**. It is one anonymous request to GitHub. No account, no tracking.

## Setting up Netgear AV switches

Mping reads switch telemetry over SNMP — port status, temperatures, SFP levels, LLDP neighbours and STP state. The switch needs a read-only community string before any of that appears.

### 1. Create an SNMP community on the switch

In the switch's **main web UI** (not the AV UI), find the SNMP section — on M4250/M4300 it is under **System → SNMP → Community Configuration**.

- **Community string** — a name of your choosing, e.g. `mping`. This is effectively a password, so avoid `public` on a show network
- **Access mode** — **read-only**. Mping never writes to a switch, and read-write access is not needed
- **Client address** — restrict it to the Mac running Mping if your switch supports it, or leave open on a closed show network
- Make sure the community is **enabled**, and that SNMP itself is enabled on the switch

### 2. Add the switch in Mping

Right-click the canvas → **Add Device**, then in the inspector set:

- **IP address** of the switch
- **Type** → *Netgear Switch*
- **SNMP community** → the string you just created
- **Ping NIC** → the interface that reaches this switch

Telemetry appears on the next poll. If nothing arrives, open **Debugging → Console Output** and filter by subsystem to see exactly which OIDs were asked for and what came back.

### 3. What Mping does and does not do

Mping is **read-only by design**. It issues SNMP GET and WALK requests only, and never SET. It cannot change a switch's configuration, and the L-Acoustics HTTP integration is likewise GET-only.

---

## Redundant networks and dual NICs

A redundant rig usually means two physically separate networks — primary and secondary — often using **the same subnet on both**. That is where macOS gets in the way.

### The problem

With two NICs on overlapping subnets, macOS decides which interface to use from its routing table, not from which cable you meant. Replies arriving on the "wrong" interface are dropped by reverse-path filtering, so devices appear offline even though they are reachable.

### The fix — static host routes

Mping generates the routes for you. In **Preferences → Dual-NIC Static Routes**:

1. Set a specific **Ping NIC** on each device in the inspector — not *Auto Routing*. Only devices with an explicit NIC can be routed
2. Open the Dual-NIC Static Routes panel and press **Apply**
3. The commands are copied to your clipboard and Terminal opens — press **⌘V** then **Return**, and enter your admin password

This tells macOS exactly which interface to use for each device, so replies are accepted on the right one.

> **Remove the routes before you disconnect a NIC.** A static route pointing at an interface that is no longer there will black-hole all traffic to those devices until it is removed. The same panel has a **Remove** button.

### Primary and secondary

Once devices are paired, the **Primary / Secondary** tabs at the top of the canvas switch the whole view between the two networks. A secondary device sits in the same position as its primary, so the layout stays identical as you flip between them.

## Requirements

- macOS 13 Ventura or later
- Netgear AV switches for SNMP telemetry (any pingable device works for basic monitoring)
- A network route to the devices you want to monitor

## Recent releases

<!-- CHANGELOG:START -->

## v0.8.21 — 2026-09-15

**Features added**
- A rack cell whose amp has gone from the switch's LLDP table stays put and turns red with the amp's last-known name, pulsing yellow while its alert is live, instead of vanishing from the rack (#115)
- Redundant pairs: a primary's rack layout mirrors to its secondary while the secondary is linked; editing the secondary by hand breaks the link, and the port box editor's chain button re-links it and copies the primary's layout over (#106)
- Typed addresses are checked and normalised: anything that is not a real IPv4 address is refused in the Inspector, the Device Manager and on paste, with the reason shown; a new device starts with an empty address, so a device genuinely at 192.168.1.100 completes setup like any other; with Auto Routing, an address on no subnet this Mac is attached to gets a warning under the field (#105, #103)

**Bug fixes**
- The menu bar is trimmed: the Mping menu reads Settings… then Network… with no Services, Hide or Show All items; the Edit menu drops macOS's Writing Tools, AutoFill, Dictation and Emoji entries; the View and Window menus are gone
## v0.8.20 — 2026-09-12

**Features added**
- Network… (⇧⌘N), under Settings… in the Mping menu, opens the Network window: the Adapters section lists every adapter by its System Settings name, kind, link state, address and prefix, MAC, MTU, VLAN tag and parent, and how many devices are pinned to it; devices pinned to an adapter or address the Mac no longer has are called out; live updates as cables and interfaces change. The Routes, NTP & Syslog and Redundant Networks panes move here from Preferences, which keeps General (#134)

**Bug fixes**
- The amp login password moves to the data-protection keychain, keyed to the team rather than to the certificate of the build that saved it, so test builds and installed releases stop taking turns asking to use it; an existing item is moved once at launch
- The Switch Credentials pane is gone: nothing ever used the login it stored, and reading it was one of the ways the "Mping wants to use your confidential information" keychain dialog appeared
- Fibre tile faces: the face labelled "Sync discards" was printing the sync timeouts counter and is now called that; Announce timeouts and Discards faces are added so all four gPTP counters can be shown on the links; a counter above zero reads red, not only while it climbs
- "AVB lost" is reserved for a port whose neighbour is a switch or LS10; an access point or other endpoint on a port reads "Not AVB capable"
- Floating port boxes print at the same text size as the racks folded into tiles; their extra width goes to the name
- The L-Acoustics P1 is a processor, not an amp: its rack rows, tooltips and alerts call it a P1 ("P1 250"), the Inspector heading reads "Amps & P1" where one is present, and its AVB Power face shows the P1's own state word instead of a dash
- The "Excluded from ping" note under an off ping toggle is gone; the switch says it
- The "SNMP / LLDP" toggle is "SNMP / HTTP", since the LS10s, amps and Nemos are read over HTTP, and it stays on every device's panel, greyed and hatched where it does not apply, instead of disappearing; the automatic name source reads "SNMP/HTTP" too
- Group Edit wears the same cards as the single-device panel — PING and SNMP toggles, the link-line mute, Auto name, type, zone, community and Ping NIC — each showing what the selected devices share, "Mixed" when they differ, and every change staged until Apply; staged settings survive adding or dropping devices from the selection
## v0.8.19 — 2026-09-11

**Bug fixes**
- A device added mid-session gets its MAC from the Mac's ARP table on the next lap, so its line to the switch port appears; before, the table was only re-read on change and a settled rig's never changes. The switches' own ARP tables are a second source, the read can no longer deadlock on a large table, and the console says every lap how many entries were read and how many device MACs were learned ("Host ARP")
- AVB Clock and Errors faces: a switch port whose device does not speak gPTP reads "Not AVB capable" instead of a dash or an ever-climbing lost-responses count in red; a monitored switch or LS10 that drops out of the timing domain reads "AVB lost"
