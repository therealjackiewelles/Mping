![Mping monitoring a live show network](docs/mping-demo.gif)

## What is Mping?

Network monitoring built for show engineers, not IT departments. Everything on one canvas, readable at a glance from the FOH position.

- Know the instant a device drops — with **no false alerts**
- Your whole network as an interactive topology map
- The numbers that matter: RTT, jitter, packet loss, fibre loss, SFP temperature and signal
- Built around **Netgear AV**, **AVB/Milan**, **L-Acoustics** and fibre rigs

## Features

*Every screenshot below is Mping's built-in example workspace — a redundant four-switch fibre rig with access points — exactly as the app draws it.*

### The whole rig on one canvas

<img src="docs/screenshots/topology.png" alt="Live topology canvas: four zones, fibre links with loss and bandwidth, an RSTP-blocked redundant path" width="100%" />

Every switch, amplifier and access point is a live tile — round-trip time, temperature and status readable from across the room. Fibre links are discovered automatically over LLDP and drawn with **per-end optical loss in dB** and **live per-port bandwidth**. Traffic direction animates toward the root bridge, and a blocked redundant path is drawn as exactly that — an orange dashed line, not a healthy link. Zone boxes group the rig the way it is racked, tiles drag freely, and a venue plan can sit behind everything (PNG, JPEG or PDF, with smart invert so black-on-white drawings read correctly on the dark canvas).

### Ping you can trust

A device is **never marked offline until a verification burst confirms it** — one lost packet on a busy network does not page you. Round-trip times are stamped by the kernel at packet arrival, so the numbers match `ping` in a terminal instead of inheriting the app's scheduling noise. Loss %, jitter and uptime are tracked per device, and jitter alerts only fire on a breach sustained across consecutive real cycles.

<tr>
<td width="55%" valign="top">

### Fibre and SFP optics, per module

Optical TX/RX power, temperature, voltage and laser bias for every SFP, read over DDM. Link labels carry the measured **loss of each direction** of every span, with alerts on your dB threshold — and a link whose light disappears goes red immediately. Copper SFPs are told apart from optical automatically, so the map never claims fibre where there is none.

<tr>
<td width="55%" valign="top">

### Spanning tree, drawn honestly

STP state lives right on the map: the root bridge wears a gold badge, blocked redundant paths draw as dashed amber, and traffic-flow arrows animate toward the root — computed from the switches' own designated-bridge votes. If the data cannot prove a direction, Mping draws **no arrow rather than a guessed one**.

### Redundant networks are first-class

Primary and secondary planes as two tabs of one workspace. Devices pair with their redundant twins, share canvas position and port-box layout, and wear P/S badges. Each plane keeps its own topology, its own link map and its own alert focus — clicking a secondary alert takes you to the secondary plane.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="55%" valign="top">

### Heat, before it becomes a problem

Both temperature sensors and all four fans of every switch, polled continuously with configurable alert thresholds. The Temperatures plane turns every tile into a **rolling one-hour graph** of sensors and fans, with hover readouts — a quiet rack at load-in and a hot one at showtime are one glance apart.

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="55%" valign="top">

### Search that knows your patch

Search matches devices — and **switch ports**, by LLDP neighbour name or by the endpoint IP resolved from the switch's own learned-MAC and ARP tables. Type an device's IP and Mping finds the port it is plugged into, opens that switch's port box, and flashes the exact cell.

### One click, whole story

The inspector shows a device's live RTT sparkline, loss, jitter and uptime, temperature history, and a card per SFP — TX/RX, temperature, voltage, bias, vendor and serial. Per-device toggles for ping and SNMP monitoring, and a protocols strip showing per-transport health at a glance.

### Set up a rig in minutes

Add a show's worth of devices in one action, then **paste names and IPs straight from a spreadsheet** — the table fills live as you paste. Bulk-edit zone, type, community and monitoring state across a selection. In redundant mode the manager pairs both networks side by side.

### And for the engineer who reads spec sheets

- **Port status boxes** — a draggable companion per switch that replicates the physical racks with your kit in: per-column heights, drag-in placement, cells labelled with LLDP name, endpoint IP or drop counters, red-until-verified on reopen
- **Alerts that latch** — offline, RTT, jitter, fibre loss and temperature alerts stand until acknowledged, with full history; recovered-but-unacknowledged shows amber, and macOS notifications reach you when Mping is in the background
- **Hold ⌥ Option** to flip every tile's IP to its MAC address, learned live from the network
- **Honest by design** — topology memory is session-only: every launch draws only what the switches prove now, never yesterday's assumptions
- **One portable file** — a workspace is a single `.mpw` including the venue plan; open it on another Mac and the whole rig comes with it
- **Multi-NIC aware** — ping and SNMP bind to the interface you choose per device, built for FOH Macs riding two networks at once
- **Show-safe footprint** — engineered for low CPU and few wake-ups so the Monitoring Mac stays cool and silent; read-only throughout: Mping never writes a single setting to any device

## Install

1. Download **`Mping-x.y.z.dmg`** from the [**latest release**](https://github.com/therealjackiewelles/Mping/releases/latest)
2. Open it and drag **Mping** into Applications
3. **First launch: right-click Mping → Open**, then click Open again

> **Step 3 is not optional.** Mping is not yet notarised by Apple, so double-clicking it the first time shows a warning and refuses to launch. Right-click → Open is the way past it, and macOS only asks once. If macOS says the app is *"damaged"*, that is the same thing — the file is fine.

Workspaces are stored in `~/Documents/Mping`, never inside the app, so updates never touch your data.

**Updates:** Mping checks GitHub on launch and once a day. Feature releases offer to download and install themselves; patch releases are quiet — check any time via **Mping → Check for Updates…**. It is one anonymous request to GitHub. No account, no tracking.

## Setting up Netgear AV switches

Mping reads switch telemetry over SNMP — port status, temperatures, SFP levels, LLDP neighbours and STP state. The switch needs a read-only community string before any of that appears.

### 1. Create an SNMP community on the switch

In the switch's **main web UI** (not the AV UI), find the SNMP section — on M4250/M4300 it is under **System → SNMP → Community Configuration**.

- **Community string** — a name of your choosing, e.g. `mping`. This is effectively a password, so avoid `public` on a show network
- **Access mode** — **read-only**. Mping never writes to a switch, and read-write access is not needed
- **Client address** — restrict it to the Mac running Mping if your switch supports it, or leave open on a closed show network
- Make sure the community is **enabled**, and that SNMP itself is enabled on the switch

### 2. Add the switch in Mping

Right-click the canvas → **Add Device**, then in the inspector set:

- **IP address** of the switch
- **Type** → *Netgear Switch*
- **SNMP community** → the string you just created
- **Ping NIC** → the interface that reaches this switch

Telemetry appears on the next poll. If nothing arrives, open **Debugging → Console Output** and filter by subsystem to see exactly which OIDs were asked for and what came back.

### 3. What Mping does and does not do

Mping is **read-only by design**. It issues SNMP GET and WALK requests only, and never SET. It cannot change a switch's configuration, and the L-Acoustics HTTP integration is likewise GET-only.

---

## Redundant networks and dual NICs

A redundant rig usually means two physically separate networks — primary and secondary — often using **the same subnet on both**. That is where macOS gets in the way.

### The problem

With two NICs on overlapping subnets, macOS decides which interface to use from its routing table, not from which cable you meant. Replies arriving on the "wrong" interface are dropped by reverse-path filtering, so devices appear offline even though they are reachable.

### The fix — static host routes

Mping generates the routes for you. In **Preferences → Dual-NIC Static Routes**:

1. Set a specific **Ping NIC** on each device in the inspector — not *Auto Routing*. Only devices with an explicit NIC can be routed
2. Open the Dual-NIC Static Routes panel and press **Apply**
3. The commands are copied to your clipboard and Terminal opens — press **⌘V** then **Return**, and enter your admin password

This tells macOS exactly which interface to use for each device, so replies are accepted on the right one.

> **Remove the routes before you disconnect a NIC.** A static route pointing at an interface that is no longer there will black-hole all traffic to those devices until it is removed. The same panel has a **Remove** button.

### Primary and secondary

Once devices are paired, the **Primary / Secondary** tabs at the top of the canvas switch the whole view between the two networks. A secondary device sits in the same position as its primary, so the layout stays identical as you flip between them.

## Recent releases

<!-- CHANGELOG:START -->

## v0.8.29 — 2026-10-06

**Fixes**
- The frame-size check no longer sends test pings to a device Mping is holding out of polling
- Two overlapping route requests to the helper can no longer leave a stale route pin: each request now waits for the one before it
## v0.8.28 — 2026-10-06

**Fixes**
- A planning or sandbox copy of Mping no longer reaches the privileged helper: it cannot add routes or set a network card's frame size on this Mac
- When Mping cannot create or write the Mping folder in Documents, it now says so on the console instead of quietly using Application Support
- Clicking a raw-dump row in the Console window shows the whole dump after the first two seconds again, and says so when the dump never reached the file
- A malformed SNMP reply with an impossible length field no longer ends the app: it is skipped like any other bad reply
- Replay plays back MSRP stream reservations from a tape, so the Streams view's gold cells follow it

**Showfile**
- The time server (NTP & Syslog: the switch, each side's address and NIC) is saved in the showfile and applied when a file opens; a file with no time-server settings (one made before this change) opens with the time server off, nothing on the Mac remembers one, and the Example Workspace carries "off", so it never asks for a rig's adapters

**Example Workspace**
- The opening splash reads "loaded 16 dummy devices" for the Example Workspace instead of "0 devices"
- Example Workspace: two LS10 pairs with amps and a P1 behind Stage Left, two Nemo 96HD meters with three hours of mains readings, gPTP readings on every link, a gold talker cell, and dotted lines from the access points and meters to their switch ports
- MPING_DEMO_FAULT=1 stages practice faults in the Example Workspace through the real alert code; MPING_FRESH_EXAMPLE=1 rewrites Example Workspace.mpw from the current demo without changing what opens
- Power-meter, switch and amp temperature histories add each reading in place instead of copying the whole history first (halves the meter recorder's cost when no graph holds the history; unchanged while a graph is on screen)
- Opening a showfile no longer brings back the previous show's fibre alerts: loading the new file's alert limits re-checked the old show's links, raising stale "x dB" / "No Link" rows (with a sound) in the file just opened
- The alert stack and the Inspector's per-device alerts draw a clock alert's legs as the red P / blue S chips the alert lists use, instead of printing ⟦P⟧ ⟦S⟧; the console's RESOLVED line reads plain like its ALERT line
- The Example Workspace draws its links again: a new link waits for a second sighting, which a demo that is never polled never gets
- A dotted line's port number sits just outside the switch tile instead of hidden under it
- The Inspector's AVB card counts hops the way the tile does: the clock master reads "(this device)", and a "2 hops" tile no longer says "3 hops away"
## v0.8.27 — 2026-10-04

**Performance**
- Panning, zooming and switching views are smoother: the map is one canvas for all three views and switches without a fade, and its background redraw waits until you let go
- Sitting idle uses less CPU: port-box labels are rebuilt only when something they show has changed, not on every ping lap and every poll result

**Fixes**
- Holding Option over a Netgear switch shows its chassis MAC, the one on its label, instead of its management MAC; a MAC search finds either
- Searching for any of a Netgear switch's own MAC addresses now lights the switch itself, not just the switches that learned that address
- Searching for a whole MAC flashes a gold border round the exact device that owns it, a tile or its cell in a port box; the results list shows only that device, and nothing if it is not in the workspace
- AVB: the "Pdelay timeouts" face and the counter alert read the wrong column of the switch and always showed 0; they now show the pdelay timeouts as the switch's own 802.1AS page does, and the alert fires on them
- Older console records are kept up to a 4 GB budget (up to 40 runs) and the newest earlier one is never deleted, so a burst of relaunches no longer pushes a show day's records out; each launch notes what it removed in the app log
- The Console window lets go of its rows when it is closed instead of re-filtering them in the background

**Features added**
- The console record warns below 5 GB of free disk, stops growing below 1 GB (the Console window keeps working) and resumes above 2 GB, all noted in the app log; a failed write or a record file that would not open is reported instead of silently dropping rows, and the heartbeat line shows free disk space
- The spacebar flips the map between the Primary and Secondary networks, whichever is up; the keys 1, 2 and 3 switch it to Overview, Temperatures and AVB
- The AVB "FIBRE TILES" rail is always on the left edge, even with the View Master's gPTP-on-links chip off; choosing a face (or pressing Shift+Tab) switches the readings back on
- Tab steps down the left rail (port-box labels on the Overview; Power, Streams, Clock and the rest on AVB); Shift+Tab steps through the AVB fibre tile faces
- Esc in the search box clears it and leaves the box, so the map keys work again at once
- AVB link faces: a new "Announce discards" face and a "Pdelay lost" face (a port dropping out of the clock), in the order of the switch's own statistics page

**[Full changelog →](CHANGELOG.md)** — every release since v0.3.0.
